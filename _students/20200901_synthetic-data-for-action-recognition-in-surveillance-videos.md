Video-based activity recognition is a research field of broad interest, particulary in surveillance video for detecting violent actions. While video-based action recognition is a popular topic in academia, annotated data for training deep neural network are rare and remain a challenge to collect. David is therefore investigating whether synthetic data can be used for activity recognition in surveillance data.
