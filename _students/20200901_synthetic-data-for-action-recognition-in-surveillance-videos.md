Human action recognition in videos is increasingly gaining relevance, with applications in both public and private life. A hindrance is the lack of large-scale datasets for video understanding which are not yet of sizes comparable to datasets for image understanding. Part of this work is to create a scalable dataset of synthetically generated data drawing on 3D computer graphics. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate whether the accuracy of existing state-of-the-art action recognition techniques can be improved by using synthetically generated data. The current state of the art and the different approaches to action recognition in video are introduced to that end. To conclusively answer the question whether synthetic data can improve the performance of current state-of-the-art action recognition techniques, more research is necessary.
