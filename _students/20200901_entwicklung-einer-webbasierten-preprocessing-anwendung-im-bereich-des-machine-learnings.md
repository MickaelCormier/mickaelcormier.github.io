Machine learning has becoming adopted widely in academia and in the industrie. However, the industry still has difficulty in deriving value from these investments. One possible reason for this is the time-consuming process of preparing data required for learning. One means to facilitate this process are so-called annotation tools. Within the scope of this work, a data processing component is implemented for an annotation tool project. The goal of this component is to support annotators to work more effectively and efficiently. These hypotheses are evaluated through a user study with several test persons using the first prototype of this annotation tool.
