The rising popularity of embedded platforms and the daunting computational cost of deep learning-based models call for efficient and accurate inference methods. Quantization belongs to them and allows transforming the model weights from high-precision to low-precision. Among the different quantization methods, Quantization-aware training (QAT) show less performance lost again their full-precision counterpart.
In this work we investigate how QAT can be applied to RetinaNet for person detection and whether it can be accelerated by further lower precision quantization.
