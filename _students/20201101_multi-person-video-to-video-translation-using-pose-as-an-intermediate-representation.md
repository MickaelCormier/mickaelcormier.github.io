Human motions transfer from a source video to a target video is an active research fields in Computer Vision. So far, previous works have transferred motions from only one person to another. This thesis aims at developing a method for multi-person video transfer. In this study the video-to-video translation using skeletal pose as an intermediate representation was employed to tackle this problem. For this purpose we collected a dataset of multiple-persons videos on  hich we have evaluated our method and obtained successful results. Different experiments are carried out in order to investigate how realistic are the synthesized images as well as real-time capability of our method and what could be done to improve the approach. The results of this work could be employed to provide means for further studies in order to generate more realistic synthetic data for training. This provides a mean to promote privacy by enabling anonymization through replacing real people by synthetic ones in datasets.
