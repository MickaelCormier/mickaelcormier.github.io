The analysis of individual behaviour in crowds in public places has gained enormously in importance this year, for example
because of distance requirements. Body poses are often used as an abstraction to not to restrict fundamental rights. The current methods for estimating human poses can be divided into top-down methods and bottom-up methods. Top-down methods typically use a person detector to detect persons with a bounding box and then reduce the problem to a single person pose estimation. In contrast to bottom-up methods which start with the localization of identity-free landmarks for all persons in an input screen followed by their grouping in personal instances. This strategy enables bottom-up methods to provide faster crowd pose estimation.
