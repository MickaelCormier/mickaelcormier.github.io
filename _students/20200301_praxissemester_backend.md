Annotation is the process of manually defining regions in an image or video and creating text-based descriptions of these regions. This is a crucial first step in building the ground truth for training computer vision models. There are a variety of use cases for image annotation, such as object, activity, emotion or
anomaly detection. Scientists use millions of annotations ranging from image captions and bounding boxes to keypoints and pixelwise class annotation. In the research group video-based safety and assistance systems we are developing a web-based deep learning annotations tool to speed up the annotation process with an intuitive UI & design and pre-processing with deep learning methods in order to improve the quality of annotations.
