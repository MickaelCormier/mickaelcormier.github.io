Since October 2020, I am a coordinator and advisor at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology for the internship (projektpraktikum) Image Analysis and Fusion.

Image analysis aims to extract information from images in the form of improved images, features or decisions. In many cases an image does not provide enough information to solve the task under the given acquisition conditions; in this case the acquisition and fusion of image series can be helpful. Methods of image evaluation and fusion are used in many fields of application, including industrial quality control, process monitoring, machine vision, traffic control and reconnaissance.

The praktikum aims to develop current and innovative methods and applications of image analysis and fusion.

The praktikum is closely linked to the lectures of the Chair of Interactive Realtime Systems (Automatic Visual Inspection and Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, Introduction to Information Fusion, Probabilistic Planning).
