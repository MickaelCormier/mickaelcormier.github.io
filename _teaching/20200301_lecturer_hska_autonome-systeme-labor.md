Current topics from the field of autonomous, reactive and interactive systems (e.g. human-machine interaction, situation analysis) are taken up and system services are specified, which are to be realized by the students in the course of the laboratory.
A realistic software development process is practiced, in which typical tasks for autonomous computer vision / deep learning have to be solved on embedded systems.

The students develop the required systems in self-dependent project teams, with continuous feedback from the supervisors during their work.
